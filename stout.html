    <h1>Stout recipe</h1>
    <img src = "recipes/stout.jpeg" alt ="stout beer">
    <p>Chris O'Brien is a homebrewer with a mission. As co-owner of Seven Bridges organic brew supplies and author of Fermenting Revolution: How to Drink Beer and Save the World, O'Brien takes homebrewing to the next level by promoting the use of responsibly cultivated, organic ingredients.

        "Making organic homebrew is no different than making regular homebrew," shared O'Brien in his article "Organic Fermentation is Sweeping the Nation" (March/April 2009 Zymurgy). "Just start with fresh, organic ingredients and the rest is the art and science of homebrewing--same as usual. The one big challenege is finding those ingredients."
        
        Of course, if you can't get your hands on strictly organic ingredients, Stout Trousers--a deliciously hoppy American stout--can still be brewed with non-organic substitutes.</p>
